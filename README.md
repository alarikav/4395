# Assignment 1 
Link: https://github.com/alarikav/4395/tree/main/assignment1
My program essentially reads and parces a data file of people's names, IDs, and phone numbers. It processes the data to make sure that everything is in the proper format and asks for user input for any data that is not in the valid format. It then displays the list of people. 

You can run this program on the command line as `python3 assingment1_axv180035 [location of data file]`.

I believe one weakness of python is that it is less memory and time efficient because it is a higher level language than Java or C++. In my opinion however, the strengths far outweigh the weaknesses. This is because python is very readable and generally more concise than other popular programming languages. There are a lot of libraries which complete a plethora of tasks and the language is very forgiving which makes for a easier coding experience. 

I learned a lot of things doing this assignment. I read up about pickle files and I learned that they serialize Python object structures and store them in binary. I also learned how to write classes in Python for this assingment. It was also fun reviewing RegEx and creating RegEx patterns.

# Guessing Game 
Link: https://github.com/alarikav/4395/blob/main/guessing%20game/assignment3_axv180035.py

This game works with the user entering their text file as a sysarg. The text processing statistics and information will print and then the guessing game will begin. The guessing game essentially takes in user input each turn and sees if the letter is in the word and if it is not it will subtract from the score, but if the letter is in the word a point will be added to the score. If the score drops below zero, the game is over.
